# AGENTS

These guidelines apply to the entire repository.

## General
- Keep changes focused on the user request.
- Follow existing project conventions and patterns.
- Prefer small, incremental edits over sweeping refactors.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless requested.

## Workflow
- Do not create commits or branches unless explicitly asked.
- Share any tradeoffs or open questions before larger changes.
- If a task requires destructive actions, confirm first.

## Documentation
- Update relevant docs only when behavior or usage changes.
- Keep docs concise and aligned with existing style.
